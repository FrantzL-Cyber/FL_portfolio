## My Portfolio

My name is Frantz Lecesne and located here will be some of my projects and classwork as I inch my way into the IT field. I was born in France, and am sitll fluent, but have also lived in the Bay Area, Sacramento Area, and in Plano, Texas. I have always enjoyed messing around with computers and playing video games. 

### College

I currently have a bachelor's degree in history, and wanted to transition into IT. This is my first semester in the field, and am hoping to have my A+ and Net+ certifications by the end of the year. Since I have finished all my general ed it should only take me three semesters to accomplish my AS in Cybersecurity.

Why Python

I am currently working on a MySQL database Key conversion utilizing TDES Encryption, but need a much better foundation with the language to accomplish it.
