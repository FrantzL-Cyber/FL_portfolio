## My Portfolio

My name is _Frantz Lecesne_ and located here will be some of my projects and classwork as I inch my way into the IT field. I was born in France, and am sitll fluent, but have also lived in the Bay Area, Sacramento Area, and in Plano, Texas. I have always enjoyed messing around with computers and playing video games. Some fun things I have been involved with include being the technical editor of the Ninja Gaiden, Prima Strategy guide, and have also been on a episode of Hawaii Five-0. As of September 2019, I am a certified CTGA TR39 Pin Security and Key Management auditor.

### College

I currently have a bachelor's degree in history, and wanted to transition into IT. This is my first semester in the field, and am hoping to have my A+ and Net+ certifications by the end of the year. Since I have finished all my general ed it should only take me three semesters to accomplish my AS in Cybersecurity.

### Why Python

I am currently working on a MySQL database Key conversion utilizing TDES Encryption, but need a much better foundation with the language to accomplish it.
Python is also a very versatile language and I hope that what I learn can assist me in future projects.

### Struggles

Many things could happen over the course of the class that could make things more difficult. As the structure has been presented so far, I feel it is going to mesh with the way I learn very well. But life finds a way, and outside influences are not always easy to dismiss and concentrate on what is important right in front of me.

### The Best

My **wife** is by far the most important aspect of my life. I would not have been able to make it this far without her and she will take precedence to almost anything else. It is also her understanding while I make this transition in our lives that continue to show me why she is so important to me.
